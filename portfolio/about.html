                    <h3>The Start of the School</h3>
                    <p>12 centuries ago, Maclea Academy was founded after the Great war between humans and enchantment. The 5 founders despised the idea of humans and enchantment fighting, so they created a school where humans and enchantment were together to make peace. In a hill lies a castle, that was hidden among the himelayas. Letters were sent to the chosen students</p>

                <div class="course-col">
                    <h3>The 5 founders</h3>
                    <p>The school was found by None other than Amelia Meadows, Christoph Blaine, Minahil Emeralds, Hubert Discord and Their Leader Freya Frost. The 5 ruled the school, once enemies now they have joined and made peace. The 5 somehow vanished after they sacrificed themselves for their dear school. Some say they are still in the school, hiding amongst the shadows. </p>

                <div class="course-col">
                    <h3>New Maclea Academy</h3>
                    <p>12 decades later, the school was re-opened after someone claimed to be the Great Granddaughter of Amelia Meadows and Hubert Discord of 12 decades, re-opened the school in honour of her grandparents. That person turned out to be Our Principal Macey Antonette. She rebuilt the school and old Alumni's sent their children to learn after finding out about the new school. While letters were sent again.</p>
